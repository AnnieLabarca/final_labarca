					<h3>Background on Greenhouse Gasses</h3>
					<p>Greenhouse gas emissions have been continuously on the rise for the past twenty years, according to recent data from the United Nations. The top three countries with the most emissions are the United States, Australia, and Germany.</p>
					<p>The United Nations collected data from countries around the world, separating into categories such as regions, years of data collection, and value of greenhouse gas emissions. With the steady increase of climate change, knowing how each country compares and where more change needs to happen is considered a priority for most environmentalists.</p>
					<p>Rithvik Doddi, a biology and medical sociology graduate student at Miami University, focused his research on climate change and how human interferences affected coral reefs this past semester, with greenhouse emissions being one of the damaging factors. Major corporations nearby were a primary source.</p>
					<p> “A lot of fertilizer use, runoff and increase in agricultural practice has been adding to increased nitric waste,” Doddi said. “Companies specifically are producing a lot of CO2 emissions.” </p>

        				<strong>I used a mixed method methodology. </strong> To ensure that I understood the full extent of my topic, I looked at both quantitative and qualitative data. The qualitative data allowed for me to piece together newer data in the context of environmental history. This included reading multiple articles from the United Nations, Environmental Protection Agency, Global Carbon Project, Scientific American, and more. My main source of quantitative data was my orignal compilation of the United Nations data on greenhouse gas emissions from as early as 1990.

					<h3>Breaking Down the Science</h3>
					<p>The United States, Australia, and Germany all have major industrial movements within, which would explain the significant amount of emissions compared to other countries.</p>
					<p>Hydrofluorocarbons, methane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride were all measured in the UN data with other factors taken into consideration, like land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF). </p>
					<p> The United States Environmental Protection Agency defines hydrofluorocarbons as a kind of synthetic greenhouse gas that is typically emitted during industrial processes and is considered “High Global Warming Potential” as they are potent. </p>
					<p> The EPA additionally states that methane is emitted during the production of coal, natural gas and oil. Nitrous oxide is emitted during agricultural, land use, industrial activities, combustion of fossil fuels and solid waste, as well as during treatment of wastewater. </p>

					<h3>Potential Solutions/Looking Ahead</h3>
					<p> Doddi had the opportunity to see how the United States compared to other countries, and found that the problems the U.S. faces can partially be chalked up to capitalism.</p>
					<p>“There are cleaner methods of transportation and mass production being developed and used in other countries,” Doddi said. “There’s a huge economic bias in the U.S. that has companies not implementing those practices and techniques, which is a huge issue.” </p>
					<p>Carbon dioxide, one of the most commonly emitted gasses, enters the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels. Luckily, there seems to be a fairly easy solution to combat its effects: the planting of trees or anything that will take in CO2 to live. </p>
					<p> The United States holds the record for the highest recorded greenhouse gas value in 2007, standing at 7,442,207.96 emissions. This included indirect CO2 without LULUCF, in kilotonne. </p>
					<p> The COVID-19 pandemic only brought more attention to the problem: a time that should have vastly helped as a result of most production halting barely reached the atmosphere according to the Global Carbon Project. The atmospheric buildup stayed the same rate as previous years despite the fact that climate scientists estimated a 7% reduction in emissions. </p>
					<p> Both the United Nations and scientists working from the Global Carbon Project have stated and proven that a steady, consistent reduction of greenhouse gasses is necessary in order to see change in the future, which will require improvements on both the national and individual level. </p>
					<p> “I think a lot of people are not well informed enough and realize how easy of a change they themselves can implement in their lives,” Doddi said. “Little changes like taking a bike to work instead of taking a 10 to 15 minute Uber can make a big difference in the long term.” </p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Plenty of activists and non-profit organizations actively work to continue educating people on the steps they can take to help the environment. Popular figure Greta Thunberg emerged as a “trailblazing leader” as she spoke to not only leaders of multiple nations but to younger generations, encouraging teens to make their voices heard. </p>
			<p>Scientists have continued urging people to understand that the fight against climate change is not one that can be handled at a national level within countries, but rather an active commitment to future versions of life that occupy the earth. The Paris Climate Agreement supports this, as it holds every single participating party and country accountable for reaching the established goals.</p>
			<p> Today, there are hundreds of groups across the world that have been established, including the Arab Forum for Environment and Development, Asia Pacific Adaptation Network, Biomimicry Institute, C40 Cities, and Climate Collaborative. Data in the future will determine whether or not more serious policies need to be implemented, as the pandemic was a natural improvement but cannot be imposed in the future by force, scientists from the Global Carbon Project assert. </p>
			<p> Researchers like Doddi will continue providing more information in future works as time goes on. His message, and the message of those on the forefront of environmental agencies globally, is clear: greenhouse gas emissions will only continue affecting every part of human life if nothing is done. </p>
